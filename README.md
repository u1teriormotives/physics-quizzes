# physics-quizzes

taking AP Physics I? well so am i! in collaboration with my friend, RowdyMoose (not on github), we
came up with the idea for a physics question generator with random values from our physics teacher
using moodle to randomly generate values and make the answers from that.

since we have an upcoming exam, we decided we'd make something to help us study: lo and behold, a
physics question generator! (currently just kinematics, 1-D & 2-D) it's based on a seeded pseudorandom
number generator to allow you to help any and all friends who may be having problems with their
problems. copy their seed, change yours to it, and skip to the question number they're on: you have the
exact same question with the exact same values, and you can help them right from your computer!

## TODO
1. implement custom ranges
2. add more questions
